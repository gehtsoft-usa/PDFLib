How To Build.

Windows.

1) Visual Studio 2017 with C++ workload must be installed

2) CMake must be installed and available via PATH

3) Simply run win32.bat to build 32-bit version and win64.bat to build 64-bit version. DLLs will be available in Release subfolder of
   build32 and build64 folders.
   
Build static libraries using MinGW on Windows:

1) Make sure you have MinGW x32 (https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/) with base system installed to the C:\MinGW directory to build 32bit version.

2) Make sure you have MinGW x64 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/) with base system installed to the C:\mingw-w64\x86_64-8.1.0-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0\mingw64 directory to build 64bit version.

3) CMake must be installed and available via PATH.

4) If you want to build 32bit static library add C:\MinGW\bin to the PATH environment variable.
   If you want to build 64bit static library add C:\mingw-w64\x86_64-8.1.0-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0\mingw64\bin to the PATH environment variable.

5) Run cmd.exe from Haru.Native directory and run folowing command in the console (use the mingw32-make command for both x32 and x64 builds):
	  cmake . -G "MinGW Makefiles"
	  mingw32-make

6) As a result, the static library libharu23Static.a will be located in the Haru.Native folder.
	
	
Linux (CentOS)

1) Must have CentOS 7 (virtual or phisical server) with
  - GCC and G++ compilers installed
  - CMake installed

2) Copy src folder, CMakeList.txt and linux.sh files to CentOS

2.5) You may need to chmod 0777 linux.sh

3) Simply run linux.sh as ./linux.sh

4) 64-bit linux binaries will be linux64 folder

Build static and dynamic libraries using linaro toolchain for embedded arm processors:

1) Must have linaro toolchains for embedded arm processors:
      - https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/5.5-2017.10/arm-linux-gnueabihf/gcc-linaro-5.5.0-2017.10-i686_arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz
      - https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/5.5-2017.10/arm-linux-gnueabihf/gcc-linaro-5.5.0-2017.10-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz

   Linaro toolchain usually is supplied as a tar.* archive, you can extract it into the folder /opt).

2) Must have CMake installed.

3) Must have GCC and G++ compilers installed.

4) Must have ibstdc++, libz and libncurses libraries installed. 
   If no such packages available in CentOS, you should run following commands in the terminal: 

	sudo yum install libstdc++*    
	sudo yum install zlib*
	sudo yum install zlib.i686
	sudo yum install libncurses*

5) Update TOOLCHAIN_ROOT variable in the arm32-toolchain.cmake and arm64-toolchain.cmake files. 
   The TOOLCHAIN_ROOT variable must point to the root folder of linaro toolchain.

6) Copy src folder, CMakeList.txt, arm32-toolchain.cmake, arm64-toolchain.cmake and linux.sh files to CentOS
   You may need to chmod 0777 linux.sh

7) Simply run linux.sh as ./linux.sh with arm32 or arm64 command line argument.

8) As a result, the static library and the dynamic libraries will be located in the Haru.Native folder.



MacOS

1) Must have MacOS with XCode console tools installed

2) Must have CMake installed (sometimes CMake does not install command line tools properly so use
sudo "/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake-gui" --install
from terminal)

3) Copy src folder, CMakeList.txt and macos.sh

3.5) You may need to chmod 0777 macos.sh

4) Simply run macos.sh as ./macos.sh

4) 64-bit macos binaries will be macos folder

Automated Remote Build

You can also use rbuild/ scripts to build remotely on centos or macos with your windows console.

In order to do that

1) Install putty, plink and pscp utilities from
https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/
and make sure that they are in the PATH environment variable

2) Use rbuild_centos.cmd and rebuild_macos.cmd with the server ip, user name and user password as a parameters.


Android

Before building:
1) Make sure you have CentOS 7 (virtual or physical server) with installed:
  - GCC and G++ compilers
  - Android NDK r10e or later (https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads)

2) Specify the environment variable ANDROID_NDK_ROOT
(Android's NDK usually is supplied as a tar.gz archive, you can extract it into the directory /usr/local/android_ndk,
and then run the following command in a terminal: export  ANDROID_NDK_ROOT= /usr/local/android_ndk).

3) Copy src and android folders, CMakeList.txt and android.sh files to CentOS.
You may need to chmod 0777 android.sh

To build Android libraries, run android.sh as ./android.sh
As a result, Arm android binaries will be located in the android/libs folder.


iOS 

Before building:
1) Make sure that you have MacOS with XCode console tools installed.

2) Make sure that you have CMake installed. Sometimes CMake does not install command line tools properly, in this case use the command:
sudo /Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake-gui -install

3) Copy src and ios folders, CMakeList.txt and ios.sh to any directory on the Mac.
You may need to chmod 0777 ios.sh

To build iOS library and framework, run ios.sh as ./ios.sh

As a result, the Arm iOS binary libharu23.a and Haru.framework will be located in the ios/snapshot folder.
